multiple people can contribute to a live playlist of youtube videos

you have to install some node modules, still paring down the list of dependencies to things i'm actually using
run the node server on a network-connected computer

* 1st device: PLAYER 
go to <server's ip address>/player.html
connect this device to the speakers

* other devices: QUEUER
go to <server's ip address>/index.html
paste youtube URLs in the box to add them to the queue
